# The Basics of the Cube

Let's start by revealing one of the secrets of the Rubik's Cube.
From the outside, it looks like a bunch of coloured stickers moving around.
But if we open it up, this is what we see:

It's made of pieces, which are groups of stickers that move together!
That's how we should see the cube as: pieces, not just stickers.

There are three types of pieces:

<PieceTypes
  text={{
    corners: (
      <p>
        <strong>Corners</strong> are groups of three coloured stickers. They're
        always located in these 8 spots.
      </p>
    ),
    edges: (
      <p>
        <strong>Edges</strong> are groups of two stickers. They're always
        located in these 12 spots.
      </p>
    ),
    centers: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>Centers</strong> have a single sticker.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you turn any side, centers never move! So the solved colour of a
          side is always the colour of the center on that side.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  }}
/>
